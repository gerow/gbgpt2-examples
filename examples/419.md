## Gameplay

The game is a twin-stick shooter set in two dimensions, and the player sets Raid in a helicopter and helicopter gunner roles. The game plays almost identically to games like Contra, where players must shoot enemies to move forward, while Raid must guide his helicopter through a small collection of levels.

The player drives Raid through a desert environment that is in the middle of a large cave. The player can control Raid's position, and the helicopter may be moved by holding down the fire button, or by pressing the nub button.
