# Star Wars Galaxies: Galactic Battlegrounds

Star Wars Galaxies: Galactic Battlegrounds is the first Star Wars game for the Super Nintendo, which is a true game changing accomplishment in the Nintendo history. The game's mechanics are simple: put the Super Game Boy into a Super Game Boy before the age of the Game Boy, add on the power-up system for the Super Game Boy to make any combination of Super Game Boys larger and more powerful, and then add on a game mode where players race against the Galactic Battlacks. The game was the first in the Star Wars series to have a time-based progression system, not limited to single battle, but that meant there were no time-based events in this game. Instead, there were months of events that could result in the player, or a faction that had an ally and the player had to choose which events to partake in. For example, if a player was to destroy a star, that star would be destroyed, the player had to fight another person to destroy the star, or if the player had to battle an enemy, that person would have to fight them. The army of Galactic Battlacks were the locations in the galaxy where players were to fight and would have the appearance of many of the foes.

The game was a massive success, and the Super Game Boy version sold over one million units, and the Super Game Boy version was featured in the Nintendo Power Awards.

## Gameplay

The Super Game Boy version of Galactic Battlegrounds is a variation of the Star Wars series. The game uses Super Game Boys, and the game does, however, have a time-based progression system. The game also has a single battle mode, where players race against the Galactic Battlacks. The objective of the single battle is to destroy all the Galactic Battlacks, which are the enemies that the player is supposed to conquer. The game world is a large, highly detailed, Star Wars universe. The game was well received, but the Super Game Boy version is remembered for its simple mechanics.
