TwinBee is a arcade-style tower-scrolling action game that uses the limited-use of the player's limited-angle camera, as well as the player's limited-time-camera, to create challenging puzzle-solving, top-down sim-style gameplay.

## Overview

TwinBee is a puzzle-solving sim from Viacom, which is known for its arcade-style gameplay.

The game's gameplay is very simple, as the player searches his or her environment for various 7-letter numbers and words to fill out the corresponding box.

The game was released in 2000, and was released on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PC.

## Controls
