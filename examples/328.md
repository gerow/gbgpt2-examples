# Explorer

Tens of thousands of years ago, the Stone Age civilization that inhabited the Earth's continents discovered a mysterious planet and set up a colony on it. The inhabitants of the colony developed a peaceful culture, but it was not long before a certain race of aliens came into the system and began to call themselves "Explorers".

The player takes the role of a young and inexperienced explorer. He can choose to explore the world with his friends or with a crew of crew to run and find and rescue the hostages.
