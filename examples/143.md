# The Maniac Mansion

A collection of 4 minigames designed to be played in the living room.

## Overview

The Maniac Mansion is a collection of 4 mini games.

The game consists of a series of rooms for you to entertain the guests.

Each of the 4 minigames is of a certain type, and will require a certain amount of time or money.

There are many different rooms in the mansion, but players must first find the designated area.

There are a total of 6 rooms in the mansion, each room has a small number of guests.

Each guest will need food, and other items to entertain them.

The game is a bit too difficult for most people, there are many dark rooms that couldn't be used in the bedroom, and special rooms that could only be accessed in special rooms.

The mansion's theme was inspired by the classic film Maniac Mansion (allowing the player to choose the mansion's theme to play out over time).

The mansion was a huge success, and spawned the Maniac Mansion 2.
