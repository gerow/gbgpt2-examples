# Sikoboshi Special (Sikoboshi Super Heroes Series 2)

Sikoboshi Special is a spin-off of the Super Heroes series. It was released for the Sega Master System exclusively in Japan.

The sequel to the original's critically-acclaimed and highly-hyped arcade game, little is known about the game's story, characters, or gameplay. The game's gameplay is similar to that of the Super Heroes arcade games, with players moving around a series of levels for up to four players.

The game was later ported to the PlayStation, Nintendo GameCube, and PlayStation Portable.

## Gameplay

Sikoboshi Special is a platformer with a side-scrolling shooter-like aesthetic, and it's about as similar to the Super Heroes games as you can get. Players control the game's hero, named after the titular "Sikoboshi" (from the original Super Heroes), and are tasked with rescuing the princess, who has been kidnapped by a robot.

The game's plot is very simple. The heroine is on a quest to rescue the princess, who is trapped in a room full of enemies who are after the princess's power, and are after her power's location.

The game's gameplay is a bit more complex than the Super Heroes games. Players must navigate a grid of levels to find the princess, rescue her, and retrieve her power.
