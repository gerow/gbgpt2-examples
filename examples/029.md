# The First Encounter: Tales of the First World

The first in the long running Tales of the First World series, The First Encounter puts players in the role of a young warrior, his lady friend, and their quest to reach Valhalla.

## Gameplay

The First Encounter plays similarly to many traditional JRPG's; the player character is a warrior, and the game is a lot like the Legend of Zelda series.  
 

The player is in a young warrior's body, but he is a wizard. In this game, players are tasked with finding the "Sword of Acuity", a mystical weapon that restores the health of all warriors.  
 
The party is made up of a group of four warriors, and their quest is to find the Sword of Acuity. The game is divided into levels, each level being a separate dungeon. Each level has a magic item, such as an item that restores the life of a dragon, or an item that restores the health of a warrior.  
 
The game is shipped with a quick start guide, which is a quick introduction to the game.
