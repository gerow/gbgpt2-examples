## Overview

Shadow Chaser A.K.A. the Shadow Circus is a horizontal shoot 'em up developed and published by Coreland for the Sega Master System.

The sequel to the four-way horizontal shoot 'em up, Shadow Chaser A.K.A. the Shadow Circus: The Submarine (submarine) is a vertical shoot 'em up developed and published by Coreland for the Sega Master System, released in the US and Europe. Shadow Chaser A.K.A. is, however, noticeably less violent than the original. Like the first game, the Submarine has a massive arsenal of weapons and traps.

Shadow Chaser A.K.A. the Shadow Circus was released by EA in 1994 for the PlayStation 2, as well as the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and Wii.
