The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 2

Majora's Mask 2 is a 4-player co-op title that Itami has created as a tribute to his father's Metroidvania series. The game is focused on the same "arcade" modes of the Nintendo system's Majora's Mask series, but it contains a new storyline involving a dark wizard named Majora and a princess named Zelda.

## Overview

The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 2 is the third game in the franchise's first Majora's Mask game series. The game is a direct sequel to Majora's Mask, and the third game in the series to feature 3-D graphics and a 3-D multiplayer mode. Itami has also created a 3-D side-scrolling action-RPG game called The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3 for the Super Nintendo.

Majora's Mask 2 introduced the "Power Stone" mechanic in which Link is able to use weapons and items that are dropped by enemies. The player, in turn, can use these items and weapons throughout the game in a similar fashion to Mario's Super Star and Link's Awakening.

## Gameplay

Majora's Mask 2 is a 3-D adventure game that follows Link as he moves through the game. The game has many elements that Link may encounter throughout the game, such as traps and enemies, but Majora's Mask 2's gameplay is entirely focused on making Link move and interact with the environment.

Link can access a wide variety of items throughout the game, all of which have a purpose (e.g. water, windmill, sword). In addition, Link can use the familiar arrow key to access a wide variety of special items, including a shield that can block enemy attacks, a weapon, and some items.

Majora's Mask 2 also introduced the "Power Stone", a mechanic in which Link creates a shield to protect himself from enemies. Using the shield, Link can now attack, jump, and run through the environment. This is also a mechanic that Link can use for different purposes. The shield can not be created when Link is at low health, but Link can use it to save himself from dying. However, this can only be done once per match.

## Weapons
