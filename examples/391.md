# The Sea of Tomorrow

The Sea of Tomorrow is the first in the Vanquish series, a platformer/adventure game that is essentially a progression of levels. The player must complete a series of tasks, sometimes involving a robot, in order to build a reputation, gain power and eventually level up.

## Overview

The Sea of Tomorrow is a platformer developed and published by System Soft in 1987. The game is a sequel to the game's predecessor, but is set in another universe. The Sea of Tomorrow is the first in the Vanquish series, a series of levels that have been rearranged to look and feel like a video game. The player has been transported to the far-future, with a fleet of robots that the player is to destroy, in order to earn fame and fortune.

The game is the brainchild of cartoonist and game designer Robert Aickman, who was an animation supervisor on the Vanquish series. The game was not well received, and the team quickly shifted focus to creating a computer game. However, Aickman himself was unable to agree on a budget for the game, so they decided to produce it themselves. Despite protests from the studio, the game was not produced as a computer game, but instead as a graphic novel.

## Gameplay

The Sea of Tomorrow is a simple platformer. The player must use the robot's servos and an array of buttons to move, but the robot may also use his arm to attack. The robot can also swim through the water, although only temporarily. The robot can use his arm to climb walls, but he is unable to swim as well as the balloon. The robot may also use his legs to jump, but only to the extent of the balloon.

The game was known for its unique gameplay mechanics, such as the player having to predict the robot's movements. This may be necessary to avoid the robot's attacks, or to avoid the robot's attacks.

The player is able to use the robot's item-grab ability to pick up and use various items. The player can use his robot's sword to attack, but can only be able to use his robot's sword until he acquires a sword, which he can then use his robot's sword to slash with.
