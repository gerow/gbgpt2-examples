# Earth in the Sun

A top-down, side-scrolling shooter with an open-ended gameplay style. The player is tasked with using his maverick skills to overcome a series of increasingly difficult levels. The game also features a simple, but effective, gun, with a flexible ammo system. The player must inject crowd-control points into the environment with his gun, in order to keep the enemies at bay.  
 

## Plot  

Earth is in the Sun's orbit. Earth is a barren, desert planet. There is only one planet in the solar system with a rocky surface, and the player must use his maverick skills to traverse the solar system.  
  

## Gameplay    

The game is thrown together from an easy to hard to master point of view. The player must fight through the tough and often dangerous levels and eliminate all the enemies before they get over there.
