### The Last of Us: The Sequel

A spiritual successor to The Last of Us: A Thief in the Dark, The Last of Us: The Sequel builds on the gameplay mechanics of the first game, adding a new story, more enemies, and more weapons. The Sequel is set twenty years after the events of the first game, and as the game's protagonist, Joel must continue his journey to find and rescue his family and ensure a happy ending to the story.

## Introduction

The Last of Us: The Sequel is the first in the series' long running first person shooter series. The game, developed by Nerve and published by Ubisoft, was released in 2005 in the US and April 2006 in Europe. The Sequel will be the first in the series to feature a full 3D engine, and the first in the series to have a fully open world. It was also the last RPG game in the series to feature a fully animated story. The Sequel would also be the last game to be completely voiced, with the game's protagonist, Joel, being voiced by actor Alan Tudyk.

The Sequel is set twenty years after the events of The Last of Us, with the game taking place in a post-apocalyptic world. The player character, Joel, has been sent to the mysterious "last city of the dead" in order to find his family, and was tasked with helping the survivors of the city survive on their own. The Sequel would be the first in the series to feature a fully 3D engine, which the game's director, Yevgeny Zylkaev, would later refer to as "the most powerful engine ever seen in a video game". The Sequel would also be the last game to be fully voiced, with the game's protagonist, Joel, being voiced by actor Alan Tudyk.
