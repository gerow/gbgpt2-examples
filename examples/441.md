## Gameplay

The game's most prominent gameplay mechanic is the usage of the Dragon's Breath skill. The player can either attack enemies or perform special moves. In the game, the player's health is replenished by fighting using the Dragon's Breath skill.

The game also features a higher degree of mobility. The ability to move around the environment is granted by the ability to perform special moves.

This has the effect of making the player more difficult to kill, but the Dragon's Breath skill makes him more dangerous. The Dragon's Breath skill can be used to instantly kill an enemy, with the waiting period of time before the player can use the skill being turned into a timer.

The option to use special moves is available to all characters. The player can perform a special move by pressing the A button and holding the Z button. This move allows the player to perform a move that will move the object in front of the player. He can then perform an attack that will damage any enemies in front of the player.

There are several moves that are performed by pressing the A button and then releasing the button again
