# The Incredible Spider-Man 2

The Incredible Spider-Man 2 is the sequel to the game that was released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.

The game consists of three separate levels:

*   Main Story Level - SPIDER-MAN VS. DR. DOOM

*   New York Level - SPIDER-MAN VS. MOLAR

The game was developed by Warner Bros. and published by Eidos.

## Gameplay

The game is a action-platformer (and in some ways a sequel to a superhero game):

*   Spider-Man must use his webs to search for and defeat the villain.

*   The game is played in two-way linear fashion. The player must find their way through the levels in a way that suits their individual style.

For example, one might need to use his webs to traverse the stages of a subway car.

The player is looking for the "expert" Spider-Man, who will take care of all the other villains if they can get him to give up the secrets of the hotel.

The player could also find the expert Spider-Man in the subway.
