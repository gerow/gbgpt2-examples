## Gameplay

Shadow Warrior - The Final Chapter is any RPG-type RPG game, except for some of the more action-oriented ones. The player is a warrior who joins the ranks of a mercenary called the "Shadow Warrior" who gives out missions in order to aid the invading alien race known as the "Junglers".

The game has a lot of questing, gathering, and collecting of items in order to enhance one's skills and make enemies more dangerous, but also to gain experience and experience in combat. For example, in the early stages of the game the player might find a weapon that allows them to hit all enemies, but it would not be effective against the Juggernaut.

The combat is done with the "Soul Calibur" system, where the player does not have to use the sword moves, but rather the stamina system. If the player is hit, they have to press the jump button to stay up, but if they get hit again they can only stay up. This is done in the form of a meter. If the player presses the triangle button during a combat attack they would have their stamina bar increased, and if they got near enemy they would be able to attack faster and would therefore be able to kill them faster.
