# NHL 2006

After the success of the previous season, EA Sports took a page out of the book of the movie of the same name and released a sequel called NHL 2006. The game features the same roster as its predecessor, but with some new and improved gameplay mechanics. The game sees the return of several NHL players, including Wayne Gretzky, Mario Lemieux, and Michael Richards. 

Originally released in 1994-95, NHL 2006 is available on the Xbox 360 and PS3.

## Gameplay

The game is essentially a full-motion video game, with a full-body camera that can be used to take in the world and take control over the player. Players must attempt to play the puck to set up shot attempts to hit certain puck spots to make the puck move faster into the net. The puck is controlled by the stick, but players can also aim by pressing the Left and Right button on keyboards. The game has a standard player-controlled camera that players can control when looking in a direction, and when looking down at the net. Players can take several shots at goal with the puck to score a goal. The goal is to score as many goals as possible. Players also gain experience over time, and by scoring a goal, they can increase the number of shots they take, but they lose more points for each shot they miss. Other than that, the goal is to make it to the top. Players have a few choices of how they want to play the game, and can play either defensive zone, which is a more traditional NHL version of the game, or offensive zone, which is a more aggressive version of shooting the puck. Players can also play the puck in the goalie position, which is a more traditional NHL version of the game, and there are many of the same mechanics that the goalie controls. Players are also able to shoot more often, but they do so at a slower rate than in the goalie position. A player can also attempt to net a goal, but the goal is to make it past the goaltender, and it is up to the goalie to make sure the puck gets to him first. 

The NHL 2006 series is more of a sports simulation game than a traditional hockey game. The game uses a full-motion-video engine that allows the player to move around the rink slowly, but the game also features a full-body camera that the player can use to attempt to get the puck in
