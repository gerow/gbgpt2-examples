AquaVision's big selling point to the Western audience is its ability to take place in fully detailed, high-resolution environments. The game's environments are highly detailed and have large, elaborate environments. Some of these environments are recreated from actual real-life environments but are scaled down or removed to make the environments more cartoonish and less realistic. The game's own view is limited to either a first-person or a side-scrolling perspective.
