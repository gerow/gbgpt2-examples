# TES III: The Elder Scrolls IV: Summerset Isle

The game's predecessor, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, is widely considered to be the best in the series. This year, Bethesda announced that it was re-working the original game to improve its graphics while adding new features and elements. The game was re-released on the 16th of November 2007.

The game's story is told through the eyes of a young man who is captured by the Aldmeri Dominion. He is asked to become a courier between the Aldmeri Dominion and the player's faction. He must travel between Morrowind, as well as the lands of Tamriel, in a caravan of the Aldmeri Dominion's ships. He is tasked with finding the city of Riften and gathering enough trustworthy characters to travel with the caravan.

## Gameplay

The game is fairly simple in gameplay. The player is tasked with traveling to a destination and bringing to the player's faction. A large majority of the gameplay is planning ahead. The game is very unforgiving for a newcomer as it is a sequel to the original, but the game is not entirely unforgiving for a veteran. The game was also known for its reliance on the random and skill based combat mechanics.

## Gameplay

The game is a mix of action sequences, adventure games, dungeon crawlers, and RPG. There are many side quests as well as combat encounters. The game consists of a single city, a temple, and a river of lava called the Tiber. The city is guarded by several Aldmeri Dominion forces who are accompanied by guards and a caravan of Aldmeri Dominion ships. The game is also based around the idea of the "king of all creatures", the Aldmeri God of Destruction.

## Trading

The game also features a massive Aldmeri Dominion trading empire. The player is tasked with bringing to their faction the goods they desire. The items in the game are either not needed by your faction and are used to increase the strength of your faction. The Aldmeri Dominion's ships are known as "Drogaards".

## Gameplay

The game is a mixture of combat and RPG. The player lines up and approaches a target in a combat style.

### Combat

The combat in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind is a combination of sword-blades and sword-swinging.
