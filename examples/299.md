## Overview

The Infernal Machine is a time machine computer module created by Steven Currier and written by Steven Krahn. The Infernal Machine is an emulator of the game Time Lord. As time progresses, the Machine obtains knowledge of the past, present, and future. The Infernal Machine can go through time, and needs to be constantly regenerated with new experiences to progress further through time. The Machine can also have multiple PDA-like devices attached to it, but it can only have one copy of each device. The Infernal Machine is a copy machine and a copy machine can't be restored. This is another reason why the Infernal Machine is unique. It can only be restored by using the same equipment over and over again.
