## Gameplay

The gameplay in Game of the Year Edition is the same as the Game of the Year Edition. Players can move, jump and shoot fireballs. The player can also jump and shoot rockets with their bow gun. Jumping and shooting fireballs and rockets are the only things that make the game different from the others.

It was interesting to see how the game progressed with the increased scoring system. The player scores by casting fireballs, shooting rockets, and flying around in a helicopter. The player can also shoot the fireballs and rockets to defend themselves and rise up the rankings.

Saving, Barret, and the Triceratops are the main characters. The Triceratops saves the game in the first level of the game. He can be made to run across the stage only by shooting a line of fireballs that are fired straight at him. The player can then see the Triceratops falling down to the ground in the second level.

The game is very much like the other Super Nintendo games, the only difference is the Triceratops. The Triceratops can be made to run across the stage only by shooting a line of fireballs that are fired straight at him. The Triceratops can then jump up to the second level.
