Shenmue III: Shadow of the Labyrinth

The third in the renowned Shenmue franchise, adding elements from the earlier games into a bizarre exploration game inspired by the psychological horror genre.

## Overview

Shinsekai III: Shadow of the Labyrinth (also known simply as _Shenmue III_) is a 3-in-1 puzzle game developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis (released in Japan on August 17, 1995), PlayStation (released on October 19, 1996) and Saturn. The game was developed by Sega-AM2 and published by Sega, originally released in Japan on September 14, 1995 and in Europe on 1999. The game features an extensive cast of characters, each with their own story and motivations.

A sequel to the original Shenmue II, Shadow of the Labyrinth features several new scenes, including a new story and game over.

## Gameplay

Shadow of the Labyrinth is a puzzle-action dungeon crawler similar to its predecessor, and this is where the game differs from the original. The player has to explore each level by collecting a variety of coins and gaining experience.

The player is able to go through the maze-like environment of the labyrinth, but it is required to complete each level to gain experience. Each level forces the player to use the mouse to point to the center of each level, which is in turn required to proceed to the destination.

As with the original, the player is able to interact with countless objects and items, with the player needing to pick up a variety of items to progress. Items, however, are not necessary in order to progress through the game.

Shadow of the Labyrinth's gameplay is very similar to earlier classic puzzle game games in the series, such as Riven or The Legend of Zelda. It is a relatively simple game with a well-designed, well-built environment, and a well-designed and well-executed puzzle-solving system.

The player is able to use the mouse to point to the center of the maze, and this is where the player needs to interact with numerous objects and creatures to progress further.

## Enemies

Shenmue III's enemies are rather simple. The player is able to interact with an assortment of creatures, as well as a handful of traps. These include rats, mice, scorpions, tarantulas, snakes, and firebreathers
