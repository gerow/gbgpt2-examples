Uranus: The Descent

An original adventure game made entirely by myself, mixed with the sounds of Symphonic and the sounds of Polyphony with the help of talented enchanters.

## Overview

Uranus: The Descent is a puzzle game where the player needs to kill a dragon in order to unlock more powerful monsters.

## Gameplay

The game is played by using the mouse to either click or click and drag any surface to a dragon's head. Combining the mouse button with the L2 key will trigger a series of actions which determine the dragon's behavior.

The player is able to raise the attack and defense levels, increase the health and magic levels, and change the color of the exterior. It is also possible to use the mouse to perform a wide variety of actions.

One of the most notable actions is the bridge attack. Using the mouse, the player can use a sword to swing across the bridge and attack any approaching creature.

Additionally, a dragon's body can be raised, lowering its weight before attacking. As long as the body is a certain size, the dragon is able to attack. In addition, the player can also perform the charm, which summons the dragon back to its owner's hand, with the exception of the dragon's head.

## Monsters

In addition to the powerful dragon, there are many beasts that the player must kill in order to progress. These are usually smaller and more agile than the player's dragon, but they have vastly more health and magic levels.

### Dragons

### Dog

Dog is one of the most common dragons in the game. It is the first dragon the player sees. It is a pacifist, very fast and very weak dragon, which makes it a good target.

When the player kills a dog, a green dragon falls out of the sky, and the player can now summon the green dragon. The green dragon is fast and strong, making it a fierce foe. It is the only dragon without the tail, but it has a very wide range of attacks and can be used to attack, but not with its tail.

The player can summon at most three dragons at a time, but they are not limited to. The game is only over once the player has one summoned dragon, but they can choose to summon another.
