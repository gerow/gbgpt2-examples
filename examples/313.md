# Yoshi's Woolly World 2

The sequel to the Wii game Yoshi's Woolly World, Yoshi's Woolly World 2 features the same episode-specific gameplay as the Wii game but now in the form of a 2D platformer that allows players to jump, turn, and jump (as in the Wii version). The game also features a new style of combat (the "takedown") where players use combos and the ability to dodge attacks to break a character's health.  
  

## Gameplay

In Yoshi's Woolly World 2, players can shoot the Sonic the Hedgehog's cannon balls (allowing the player to target enemies or when attacked by some enemy) and can also perform a variety of other attacks from the Yoshi's arsenal. The cannon balls will only fire for a short period of time, however, and if the cannonballs touch an enemy, they will explode and have a wide range of damage. Additionally, a series of attacks make up the overall course of the game. In addition to the cannon balls, the player can shoot a cannon ball at a faster rate of fire (moving closer to the cannon ball) and can fire a cannon ball while moving at a higher rate (getting closer to the cannon ball, but still firing the cannon ball). This furthers the goal of the game, emphasizing speed, speed, and speed.
