The Boss Explosion II

The Boss Explosion II is the sequel to the original Boss Explosion. The game is a mix of platformer and racing, and featured a new control scheme as well as a new protagonist: the "Big Boss".

## Overview

Boss Explosion II is a platformer set on the outskirts of a post-apocalyptic world, and features a new control scheme as well as a new protagonist. The game was developed by Koei and published by Sega, and developed by Westwood Studios. The game featured an arcade-style fighting game mode, similar to that of Street Fighter III (where the player can use the joystick to control the character's punches, kicks, and throws), and a new "boss" mode. The game's first boss, the "Boss", was first introduced in the 1990s, first in a fighting game, and then in a sequel.

The game was published by Sega, and distributed by Sega themselves. It was the sequel to the previous game, Boss Explosion.

## Gameplay

Boss Explosion II's gameplay focused largely around its platforming. The player's movement is controlled with the D-pad, and the player can control the character's energy bar, which is a meter of bullet-shaped energy. The player can then attack and defend by pressing the R trigger, or simply move the joystick around. Most of the character's attacks and special attacks are performed by pressing the button, and the character can also use a unique attack, which is performed by pressing the button. This attack can be performed by pressing the up and down buttons simultaneously, and the character can also perform a special attack, which is performed by pressing the button multiple times.

In addition to the special attacks, the game also featured a new set of weapons, and these weapons were all much more powerful than the previous weapons. For example, a rocket launcher was able to kill a boss in single bullets, and a shotgun could kill a boss in a single shot. Weapons are also more effective against bosses, as bosses are much smaller and heavier than the player, making them easier to kill.

*   Nothing.
