The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is a 3D spin-off of The Legend of Zelda (released on the Super Nintendo in 2001).

## Overview

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is a 3D platformer developed for the Super Nintendo (using an upgraded hardware) and was released in 2001. It was a direct sequel to the original (the main NES game The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening, but only in Japan, developed by Nintendo themselves).

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D is known in Japan as _Legend Of Zelda: The Adventure of Link_, but in the US it is simply referred to as _Ocarina_. The title of the game is also connected to the history of Zelda.

In addition to the basic controls of the NES title, the game features new weapon and enemy types (such as the Knight's Sword from The Legend of Zelda, the Triforce from The Legend of Zelda and the Dragon's Sword from Zelda II: The Adventure of Link) and even different music style (such as the fire-themed soundtrack of The Legend of Zelda). The game also introduced the "Up" button, where Link can perform several special moves (such as ground-climbing and climbing).

The game has numerous gameplay elements, such as several items (such as the cannon and sword, the latter of which is an item in the original Legend of Zelda). Other than these, the game was known for its unique art style (which, unlike many other games of the time, was designed by Nintendo themselves).

The game was also known as _Legend Of Zelda: The Adventure of Link_, but the game in Japanese text-speak is simply _Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_, and the game in English is _Legend of Zelda: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time_.
