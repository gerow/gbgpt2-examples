In the Cantina rules setting, players are tasked with creating an empire of taverns at the height of their economic power. Players are using their taverns as either an economic engine or a political machine. Each tavern has its own unique features, such as lace, a special chance to become the king, or a unique flavor.

On the front end of the game, players are invested in a mayor, who is responsible for building neighborhoods and businesses for local trade. As more businesses are built, new citizens are drawn in to the city, which in turn, increases their wealth. Mayor is not the only player involved in the game, however, as he can hire mercenaries to do the dirty work for him.

## Features

### Cities

Each city has a variety of features to help build a thriving economy. Each has an assortment of shops, taverns, and other buildings.

There are three kinds of cities:

*   Wealthy: The most prosperous cities. These cities are linked together by the Golden Circle of Connectivity. They have many bars, restaurants, and other amenities. Wealthy cities often have important landmarks like monuments of the past or landmarks of future.
 *   Poor: The poorest cities. These cities are linked together by the Golden Circle of Connectivity. They lack many amenities and are less prosperous than the wealthy cities.
 *   Compliant: Cities which are compliant with the Law of Poverty. These cities are linked together by the Golden Circle of Connectivity. They tend to have more amenities and more people. Compliant cities tend to have a better quality of life and more merchants.

The cities can be locked down by certain buildings such as a lighthouse, or a city can be built to an industrial scale, which in turn provides benefits to everyone.

## Development

A player can make a lot of money building out a city by building a good tavern and a restaurant. They can then expand their city by expanding the economy with docks and docks are expensive. People are attracted to cities with docks and docks are a great way to attract citizens due to the abundance of docks.

Every city has a certain number of docks which can be built and more docking locations can be built up by having more docks. The more docks, the more people will move to the city.

The game starts in the city with the taverns, where they have to choose which buildings they want
