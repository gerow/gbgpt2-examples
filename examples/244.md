# Nuisance:

A third-person shooter from Ubisoft Entertainment.

## Overview

Nuisance is a third-person shooter created by Ubisoft Entertainment and published by Ubisoft for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The game's story is told through third-person perspective, and players can control either a single or two-person squad of four troopers by pressing a button. As the game's storyline progresses, the player is given objectives to complete, and the player can be challenged to complete them by either a objective score of the players. The objective is to collect all weapons, armor, and ammunition available for each mission, and to make sure the objective is met.

The game is a direct sequel to the earlier game, Nuisance: Titan Assault, but the gameplay is very different. The game features a 2-D, fully 3-D environment, and the player can move around the environment and even jump. The game's combat was not a traditional shooter, but rather a combat game. The player can use explosive weapons, such as the grenade launcher, and a laser cannon. The player can also use guided bombs and rockets, which have a variety of effects. Each weapon can be hit, and the player is treated to the same enemy; the game's score is based on the player's accuracy with each weapon.

## Weapons

All weapons in the game are capable of damage, and the player is able to kill many enemies with their weapon. It is important to note that these weapons have a very short range, so the player needs to make sure the weapon can reach its target. In addition, a number of weapons have alternate firing modes. For example, the laser cannon fires three waves of bullets at a time, with the first wave hitting an enemy and damaging their armor.

There are also a number of weapons that can be used for damage, such as the grenade launcher. The player can pick up these weapons, and they can be thrown at enemies. They can be thrown back, and they can be fired back, as well as being able to pick up the grenade launcher. The grenade launcher can be fired back, allowing the player to fire while moving.
