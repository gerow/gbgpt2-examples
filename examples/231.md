# The Legend of Dragoon

The Legend of Dragoon is a Japanese anthropomorphic coin-operated game developed and published by Nintendo.

## Story

Most of the game takes place in the Southwestern Kingdom of "The World".

The Story follows the story of Dragoon, a humble swordsman who has been trained to become a knight by the gods.

After being offered a job by the king of the world, Dragoon, a bright and talented young swordsman, is hired by the King of The World to defend his homeland.

In his first days as a warrior, he begins to learn the ways of fighting. He eventually learns to use magic, and eventually learns how to summon the spirits of the dead.

The game is set in a fantasy world, where magic is created and a human named Dragoon is trained to use magic.
