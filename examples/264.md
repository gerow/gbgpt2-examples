A sequel to the original, in which you play as a roof warrior who must halt the evil roof warrior crime syndicate.

## Overview

Roof Warrior 2 is a 2D action-adventure game developed by Arc System Works and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the Sony PlayStation in July 1996.

Originally released for the Dreamcast in October 1995, the game was developed by Arc System Works and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation in 1996. The game was developed by the same team that developed the PlayStation 2, but was published by a different studio. The game featured a unique feature of modifying the player's character by wearing different armor pieces. For example, a player could move with the same amount of movement speed as a human and could also do more damage.

The game also featured a map, showing the locations of what the game referred to as 'roofs', which would be the player's base of operations. The locations for each area of the game were randomly chosen based on the player's map. In the end, the player could choose the locations to build bases in.

The game was not a spiritual successor to the Dreamcast's earlier titles, but it did feature a different interface and mechanics. In the game, the player could use the left hand to control or attack - and the right hand to attack or block. The game also introduced a different style of game called 'micro-games', where players could build up a small army of units, and expand it by shooting them down.
