The Ghost World is inhabited by ghosts, and in order to defeat the ghosts, the player must kill the ghosts. Ghosts can be found in nearly every area of the Ghost World, and these ghosts can be hunted down and killed, providing the party with a limited amount of equipment.

The player's party member are all levels of difficulty, and the player can only have one party member at any given time. The party must fight many of the ghosts to defeat the ghosts, and these ghosts are more powerful than the player's party member, and are therefore better equipped to be killed. The party member that was killed must be replaced by an identical party member, and the game must be restarted from the beginning.
