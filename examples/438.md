## Overview

Super Mario 64: Super Mario World is an action-adventure game developed by Nintendo and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992.

Super Mario World is known for its emphasis on balance and exploration compared to other yeti games. The player is a young, fragile hero who must take on the role of a super powered turtle and must search for new lands, enemies, and friends.

Super Mario World was one of the first games to feature a Super Mario World style mine cart system, making it a sequel to the previous game, Super Mario World. Players could use a mine cart to travel to new locations, finding gold in the process.

Super Mario World introduced a plethora of Mario-related items, such as the egg-slaying snail and the mushroom cloud. These items and items allowed players to build their character, which in turn allowed players to save the world.

The game has also inspired many other Mario-related products including Super Mario World-style characters, the Mushroom Kingdom, and secret locations.

## Gameplay

Super Mario World is a platformer that revolves around the turtle's ability to use his shell and function as a "super hero." The player controls the turtle's shell, which is linked to the turtle's shield. Turtle's shield acts like Mario's, allowing him to jump and climb and get up to higher ground. The turtle also has a unique ability of turning into a fireball which keeps him safe.

Characters can be different, however, with some being more agile and others being more agile. The player can also transform the turtle into a ball, which is stronger and faster than a turtle.

A number of items are also found in Super Mario World, including the mushroom cloud, the egg-slaying snail, and the mushroom power-up.

The player can also find a number of items and weapons, such as the mushroom puke, the Super star, the mushroom cannon, and the mushroom rider. The player can also acquire a variety of unique items, such as the mushroom barrel, the mushroom flute, and the mushroom bomb.

Super Mario World also introduced a number of new items, such as the mushroom bucket, the mushroom helmet, and the mushroom costume.
