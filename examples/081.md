# Yaku! Rulue

The game's protagonist, Rulue, is a young but highly skilled warrior. But he's in trouble, and his downfall is only beginning.

## Overview

Yaku! Rulue: The Game is a "drama" game developed and published by THQ for Sony PlayStation in Japan in 1997.

The game is a in-depth RPG, where players can choose to be a warrior (who can choose to be a warrior in the story) or a warrior (who just wants to kill). Like many other RPGs of the time, it featured a unique combat system, which encouraged players to think outside of the box, and to create their ideal character based on their combat abilities and fighting style.

The game was later released on PC, Mac and Final Fantasy X-2 for the Mac (in the form of a Virtual Console game).

## Gameplay

Players are given the choice to be a warrior or a warrior. Both sides have their strengths and weaknesses, and as such, can do whatever they like to do. The only thing that comes with being a warrior is knowledge and experience.

A lot of the combat involved came from the ability to use attacks such as Axe, Flurry, and Kick.
