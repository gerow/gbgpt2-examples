## Overview

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is a 3D side-scrolling action game. It was developed by Arc System Works and published by Sega in 1995. It was the first game developed for the Sega Master System and was considered a "masterpiece" by Sega. It was also the first 3D side-scrolling action game to feature the Sonic Guard/Power Gauge system. The game, like the Shining Force series, is a direct port of the original game, with new graphics and controls. The game was developed by Arc System Works and published by Sega in 1997. It was the last game in the series to be released on the Sega Master System, but still features the Sonic Guard/Power Gauge system.

## Gameplay

The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel is a triple-A action-RPG. It has a unique combat system, similar to the Shadow of the Colossus series. The combat is powered by the Shadow Force engine, which is a 2D action game. The combat is both fast and hard, but it also features a good variety of weapons and armor.

The game features a number of skills, such as combat, magic, and skill. Skills are divided into three levels, each having a set of skills. The player can raise and use the attributes of each skill of each level, improving the attributes of each level. This has the effect of increasing the stats of the character.

A level up system is also present in the game. However, the game is split up into three main eras. The first is the normal world, or the "pre-expansion" world. The second is the expansion world, or the "expansion" world. The third is the expansion world, or the "expansion" world.

This system is quite similar to the Fire Emblem series. The player can raise and use the attributes of the character in the same order as they are in the main game.

## Characters
