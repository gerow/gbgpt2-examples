## Overview

Tetris 25th Anniversary Edition, the 20th iteration, was released on the Nintendo Wii on September 21, 2011. The game's predecessor was released on the Sega Genesis on February 15, 1987.

Tetris 25th Anniversary Edition is the last in the long running series of games for the Nintendo Wii. It was developed by SCEE and published by Sega. The game, like its predecessors, was a "remastered" version of Tetris from the Genesis version. It received many upgrades and features such as a new 3D engine (known as the "Tetris Pro") and improved visuals.

The game received numerous promotions and was known for its innovative gameplay, challenging puzzles, and linearity. The game was also praised for its overall quality and graphical overhaul.
