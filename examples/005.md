Ring of the Gorgon

Gorgon warriors have unlocked the ability to summon Gorgon Spears and Gorgon Knights. The Gorgon Knights will attack the player with their long, spiked halberds. Unlike the Pike and Shotguns, the Gorgon Spears are a melee attack, and have the same damage and ammo.

## Overview

The Ring of the Gorgon is the third pre-historical game in the Ring of the Gorgon series. The game launched the franchise into the modern era, and spawned the BG series. The sequel, Ring of the Gorgon 2, launched the series into the future, and spawned the MMORPG series.

Prayer levels are three levels lower than the player's level, so prayer levels are more common in setting. Prayer levels have less prayer points, as the prayers require more prayer points. The prayer level is not the same as the prayer level, however. The prayer level is simply the
