# The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D

The Legend of Zelda 3D is an NES adventure game developed by Nintendo. It was released in the United States and Europe on March 31, 1990.

Background: Majora's Mask 3D is the third entry in the franchise and the last in the rather unique mix of action-adventure and platforming. Unlike most action-adventure games these days, Majora's Mask 3D is set in a school, and players are tasked with solving puzzle-based puzzles and solving the mysteries that surround the school. The game is notable for its use of a left- and right-handed directional pad, and this was a first for the Nintendo 64.

Majora's Mask 3D features a series of puzzles and a number of side-quests to help players progress through the game. The game also features a number of special items that can help in the game's mission, such as minor props that can make the player's character more powerful, or "gems" that can be used to create new items.

Although the game was generally known for it's length, it is typically considered to be one of the longest ever made for the Nintendo 64. Majora's Mask 3D was first released in Japan on September 7, 1990 and later in North America on October 5, 1990.

A sequel, Majora's Mask 3D: Shadow of the Colossus, was released for the Wii, and has since sold over one million units worldwide. Majora's Mask 3D is notable for its use of a stylus, allowing for the player to manipulate objects in the environment using the stylus.
