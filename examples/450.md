NTR

NTR (now known as The RealTek) is a 2D side-scrolling platformer game known for its unique gameplay and constant need for player intervention.

## Overview

NTR is a 2D side-scrolling game developed by On Shuri and published by Activision for the PlayStation, Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, and PC (DOS).

The player controls a small robot named NTR (or "RealTek" in Japan) who must collect different colored orbs, which can be combined to make better robots.

## Gameplay

Players must first collect the orbs and then maneuver the robot to the most optimal location for the orbs to appear. At any point in the game, the player can attempt to use his robot to attack, or block, enemies.

At any point in the game, the player can attempt to use his robot to attack or block enemies. When the player uses his robot, the game will be over.

The game is a bit reminiscent of other platformers, with the player using NTR and his robot to attack enemies. If NTR hits an enemy, the game will turn to the other side, and the player will have to fight the enemy directly.

The game can be a bit difficult to control due to the robot's large size. If the player is not careful, he can often have to threaten the robot's head with his small arms to break away to avoid damage. An example of this can be seen in this video:

## Development

RealTek was developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Activision, and originally published for the Sega Master System in March 1984.

The game was developed by real time, back-to-back, and built by real-time, back-to-back, and real-time 3-D.

The game was not released as a Virtual Console game due to the nature of the game, and the manual had to be generated for the game.

While it is not a very long game, RealTek includes a large number of characters in this game.
