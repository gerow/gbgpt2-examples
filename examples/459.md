## Overview

Jak and Daxter is a two-dimensional, action-videogame developed by Kemco and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System on January 16, 1991. The sequel to the critically acclaimed Jak 3: Riptide, Jak and Daxter is a light gun-themed platformer with platforming elements. The game features a new stylized version of Jak's helmet, which grants Daxter the ability to shoot vertical lines of bullets. As the game's title suggests, the player is shooting upwards at top speed using the light gun, and can shoot down to earth at the bottom.

## Gameplay

Jak and Daxter is a platformer, where you can shoot your «gun» to earn points. The game uses the light gun's range to shoot upwards, and to shoot down. After shooting down all the way to the top of the screen, you are presented with a «targa» of space to shoot on. The player's total score is based on the number of bullets he or she shoots. The bullet itself takes the form of a bullet, that explodes when the player shoots it.
