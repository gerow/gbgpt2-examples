# Metroid Prime 2: Echoes

The sequel to the hit Metroid: 2.0, Echoes is a Metroidvania-like platformer. Players are sent to a planet called Samus Aran to do his job.

## Overview

Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is a Metroidvania-like platformer developed by Omega Force and published by Nintendo for the Super Famicom in Japan on March 15, 2002.

Set shortly after the events of Metroid Prime 2: Samus Returns, players are sent to a planet called Samus Aran to work as a secret agent for the mysterious organization known as Osmosei. After saving a girl named Krayt in the game's final levels, she is tasked with going through the planet's castle and stopping Osmosei's leader, Vio.

Metroid Prime 2's story is told through a 3D cutscene where players are able to use the power of their gun, Samus Aran, and use a grappling hook to move between levels. When there are many levels to accomplish, the player can use the grappling hook to travel in different directions.

## Gameplay

Metroid Prime 2: Echoes features many of the same units and abilities as Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, but with a variety of upgrades.

The game's gameplay is much more linear than its predecessor. The player is tasked with rescuing Krayt in a variety of scenarios; however, Krayt can only be rescued one time. This is a change from Metroid Prime: Samus Aran, where, in addition to rescuing Krayt, the player is able to rescue people throughout the game.

The game's exploration is also more linear, with the player only reaching certain areas when a certain number of levels have been completed. These levels must be completed in order to progress further.

Metroid Prime 2: Echoes also has an RPG-like combat system, with the player being able to use the Z-pad and button for attacks, and the D-pad for jumping. These have become Nintendo's go-to weapon for fighting enemies.

## Weapons

The Gamecube's 32-bit counterpart of the Metroid Prime series, Samus Aran's weapon arsenal is extremely small. The player is able to equip only one weapon at a time, and must find a way to get to all the weapons that are available in the game. The
