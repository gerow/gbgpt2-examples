Doomsday: Dead or Alive

Executioner Zangief strikes back at the evil mastermind who assassinated his father!

## Overview

Doomsday: Dead or Alive is a comedy/action-platformer developed and published by Capcom for the PlayStation on November 17, 1998.

The sequel to the successful arcade game Doomsday: The Movie, Dead or Alive is a sequel to the arcade game Dead or Alive 2. The player controls a scientist who must kill the evil mastermind who has been responsible for the death of his father, a fictional scientist who is a parody of the real-life scientist who has gone by the name of Professor Zangief.

The game features several new features, such as the addition of the ability to transform into many different forms, as well as a new weapon, the S.S.R.H.A.R.L. (Special Shooting Star).

The game received numerous sequels and spin-offs, but did not sell well.

## Gameplay

The game is very much like its predecessor, but the player's health is not as high as in the first game. The player must dodge and avoid the attacks from Zangief's head until he hits bottom, where his health would be lowered. This is the only game where the player can transform into a helicopter, but cannot transform into a pirate, police officer, or nuclear scientist.

The player must dodge and avoid the angry heads of Zangief's henchmen, which can be controlled and controlled into melee combat, but will not attack back.

The game is a lot more arcade-y than its predecessor, allowing the player to use the ladders to climb up and down, navigate the level, and make a "box" around the enemies.

The game features a much larger arsenal than the first, with many weapons, including the Antitoxin gas, which can be used to kill the player instantly or to save the player from death. The game also includes more dynamic weapon upgrades.

## Weapons

The game contains 8 weapons, each having their own unique characteristics.

All of the weapons are unique, and the player must choose between them to achieve their goal.

*   Bullet: The
