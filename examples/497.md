Mystique

Mystique is a 2D platformer, in which characters must navigate a virtual world that is full of tentacles and other creepy-crawlies.

## Overview

Mystique is a 2D platformer developed and published by 2K Games for the PlayStation and PC (via Steam) in December 2001. The game has no storyline, but rather traverses such worlds as a city and an alien world. The player must use his or her hero skills to traverse the various levels, and can even explore the warp zone where the player can travel between the worlds.

The game was originally released in July 2002, but was also released as a Steam Early Access title in July 2016. The game was first available for purchase as a demo in June 2009, and as an Early Access title in January 2016.

## Gameplay

The game has you exploring through a 3D world, and manipulating and controlling a variety of tentacles, such as the monster's sister, the water-spout, or the harpy's lover. You can create your own tentacles, and each of them have their own unique abilities. You can also find the pieces of the enemy's body, which allow you to use your own tentacles to perform a variety of tricks. You can also use the harpy's lover as a barrier, which prevents the harpy from progressing to the top of the screen.

## Hub Worlds

Mystique is a hub world. Here you can visit other characters, such as Ghorkov or Balthazar. You can even access the character's home world, which is a game world similar to Myst.
