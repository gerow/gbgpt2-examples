The Epic of Fighter

The Epic of Fighter was the first game in LucasArts' Star Wars series, and the first game to feature a real-time turn based strategy mode where the player was encouraged to expand their armies from a limited number of units to something more like the RTS genre. The game was developed by LucasArts, and published by                                              
  

Gameplay is similar to that of other games in the genre; a general strategy game where the player is instructed to build armies, which are then tasked with participating and combatting in various battles. Battles are fought using a single unit of troops, and are followed by a final battle, where the player has to balance and prevent a strategic victory.

## Gameplay

The Epic of Fighter is a tactical strategy game in which the player - who is the leader of a large army - must recruit new units, which must be placed in the appropriate locations within the army. The recruitment of the new troops is done in a turn-based system, and a number of units can be assigned to a particular unit of troops. The player then has to balance his forces to allow for a desired number of units to be placed in the desired location. The game also has objective-based gameplay, where the player is tasked with winning a number of combat missions, which involves the player performing a number of tasks and then attempting to execute the assigned task. An objective is given, and the player must complete a number of tasks and report back to the commander of the organization that has given the objective. The commander then receives the report, and a number of actions are taken. However, in order to complete the task, the player must also achieve a certain number of victory points, and success is not guaranteed.
