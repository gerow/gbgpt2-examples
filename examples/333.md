## Overview

Hydro Thunder is a 2D racing game in which players can race cars with different power ups. The player can choose from different cars, such as the Ferrari F458, Lotus F1, Mercedes-Benz Roadster, and Maserati S500. The game is also available on the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network as a downloadable title.

The game was released for the PlayStation in 1998, and the Xbox Live Arcade in 2003. The game was re-released for the PC (on Steam) in 2011. The game features a fan-made engine that can be used to create custom 3D rides. These custom rides are then put into the game with the original game engine.

## Gameplay

Hydro Thunder is a 2D racing game. The player must navigate their car through the world. The world is populated with many different types of cars, such as:

*   US cars
*   Euro car (except BMWs)
*   Speedsters
*   Lamborghini Gallardo
*   Jaguar E-tune
+   McLaren F1

The player can choose from different power ups, such as:

*   Supercharger - increased speed and acceleration

*   Turbo - increased speed and acceleration

The player is able to go into any speed limit, and any track, and can change the boost to a higher level. The boost is not magical; it is simply increased speed and acceleration. The player can also change the engine to a turbo engine to increase the speed and acceleration of the car. Turbo engines are only available in certain racing games, and are more powerful than the ones used in the game.

The player can also race other drivers and cars.

The game is geared towards younger gamers. The player can choose from two different game modes: race and shoot.

*   Race: The player must get around the track in a car. The player can drive through the corners, and can gain experience.

*   Shoot: The player must shoot other cars, especially during speed runs.
