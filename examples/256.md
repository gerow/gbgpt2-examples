## Story

The world of The World Ends is a fantasy-themed setting, inspired by the works of Tolkien and Dagon, and retains many elements of folklore and fantasy. It is a fantasy-fantasy land where the world is controlled by dragons, and players set out in search of the legendary Dragon. The location and time of the game are based on the Ring of Scale, a massive, labyrinthine labyrinth that is an important element in the history of The World Ends. The game takes place in the distant future. The World Ends is a fantasy land where the dragons roam freely, and the world is controlled by dragons. A young boy named Dante is looking for his father in the distant future, when a dragon named Fafnir appears and steals Dante's father's body. The young boy is taken to the very city of the Dragons, where he finds his father, and learns much about the dragons.

## Gameplay

The world of The World Ends is a fantasy-fantasy land. It is a fantasy-fantasy game with a lot of dragon-fighting. Players can attack the game's dragons, or they can attack other players, although it is advised to be cautious as there are many who will attack you, and attack you back. Players can command their dragons to join their side or attack other players, though the player must always be aware of their surroundings. The player can also use "deadly attacks", which are ranged attacks where they draw the dragon close and throw him with a slash.
