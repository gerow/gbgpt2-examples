# Space Fighter

Space Fighter is a 2D sidescrolling shoot 'em up, and its sequel, Space Fighter 2, is an even more ambitious sequel with much more music and visuals.

## Overview

Space Fighter is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up developed and published by Capcom for the Super Famicom in December 1997.

The Super Famicom version, Space Fighter 2: Super Squadron, was released for the Super Nintendo in June 1998. A PC Engine release in 1999 was published by Video System.

In the sequel and expansion, Space Fighter 2: Super Squadron 2, the player is now the leader of one of the Space Fighter's super-deformed vessel, the Space Fighter 2. Players have to collect the energy balls, hidden energy orbs that are scattered around the level. Players can then use the energy balls, or energy orbs themselves, to fuel the ship's engines.

The Super Famicom version was also developed by Capcom, and published by Capcom. Its gameplay is similar to Space Fighter 2. The player is on a super-deformed Space Fighter, and the player must collect the energy balls, often on a timer.

## Plot

The game begins with the Space Fighter 2 being chased by an army of aliens, who are in a super-deformed state. The player's ship, the Space Fighter 2, is the only vehicle that does not require fuel, and thus is able to escape the aliens' forcefield. The aliens are pursued by the Space Fighter 2, and the player's ship, the Space Fighter 2, is destroyed. As the star of the game, the Space Fighter 2, is destroyed and is replaced by a star, the Space Fighter 2, that is designated for the player. The player is now off-planet and must refuel his ship, the Space Fighter 2, by collecting energy orbs, which are scattered over the level.

The game then begins with the player's ship, the Space Fighter 2, being attacked by aliens, and having to refuel himself by collecting energy orbs. The player's ship, the Space Fighter 2, is destroyed by the aliens, and the Space Fighter 2, the Space Fighter 2, is replaced by a star, the Space Fighter 2. The player's ship, the Space Fighter 2, is destroyed, and the Space Fighter 2 is replaced by a star, the Space Fighter 2, that is designated for the player.
