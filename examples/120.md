## Overview

The final installment of Nintendo's unique strategy franchise, Adventure Island, is a rather bland platformer. It's a decent game, but not great.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is simple enough. You take control of a small island, and you must make your way around the island to retrieve the hidden treasure. The game is built for non-playable characters, and has a limited number of items to find.

The player is given the option to be a hero, and the hero unlocks when he reaches level 3 and has a large enough number of items to carry the island across the long journey.

There is no inventory system. There is no weapon upgrade tree, or new items, or items that can be picked up. There are no items that can be bought with gold, or even pieces of paper. The player is only given one gold item per day.

## System Requirements

There are no known requirements for this game. The only thing that could possibly hinder the player are bad weather, or lava. There is no land to build on, and no water to drink from.

## Gameplay

The game never looks as though it's trying to be an action game. The action involves a collected ship which is moved around to a destination, and the player's ship must reach the destination.

## Items

There are a total of 4 different items, each representing a different power in the game.

*   A sword - the player must fire the sword to damage enemies.
*   A shield - the shield is taken down to the bottom of the screen, and a shield must be shot out of the shield to get to the treasure.
*   A lantern - the lantern is taken out of the screen, and the player must use the fire button to set the lantern on fire.
*   An egg - the egg is placed under a treasure chest, and the player must use the fire button to destroy the treasure chest to get to the treasure.
*   A book - the book is hidden in a treasure chest, and must be picked up to allow the player to save the game.
*   An axe - the axe is placed under a treasure chest, and must be shot out of the axe to get to the treasure.
*   A square - the square is hidden, and the player must hit the
