# The Longest Night

The Longest Night is a 2D action-adventure-game developed and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation, Xbox and PC.

Developed by Rare and published by Sony Computer Entertainment, The Longest Night stars a young wizard, named Simon. After being sent back in time to the year 1701, Simon was sent back to the year 1715, where he is supposed to be the leader of a secret organization called the Royal Academy of Magical Creatures. However, Simon soon discovers the truth about the organization, and an evil plot is in progress to bring about the destruction of the Earth. Simon, however, is not the only member of the group, as he is the only one named in the game. The plot continues to progress, and Simon must use his magical abilities to save the planet.

The game was published exclusively in Japan, and is a follow-up to the original title. The Game Zone (now Azumajin) is a magic system in the sequel, adding new elements and activities.

The Longest Night is one of few games to feature the term "Endless Journey", which is a reference to the game's ending, which is generated by the player's actions throughout the game.

The game was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Japan and published by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe.

## Gameplay

In The Longest Night, players control Simon, who has to travel through a story-driven adventure in which he must discover and solve mystery-traversed puzzles. This game is known for its large number of puzzles, varied environments and characters, as well as its highly developed crafting system.

The main story-driven plot is presented from Simon's point-of-view, and is followed by an item-based progression system where Simon finds and uses objects in order to solve puzzles and achieve goals. Simon is able to craft his own items, but must first find an appropriate ingredient for use in the recipe.

Simon is able to travel through time and space, which is a feature not present in most games of the time. This allows him to travel with a calendar attached to his back, and a daily track of how many days he has left.

Simon can also travel to places in the future, and as the game progresses he learns about his parents and the secret organization he is a part of. These events will affect the plot of the game.
