# The Legend Of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds

The Legend Of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is a third-person action-platformer developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the GameCube in early 2003.

A Link Between Worlds follows Link's adventures as he travels through the Legend of Zelda world, learning from various characters, including princess Zelda, the three mythical monsters known as Deku, and one more: the legendary Dark Zelda. The game is divided into three parts: The first is the basic tutorial, followed by the main game, and finally the gameplay elements, such as the item stacking, dungeon exploration, and overall gameplay.

The Legend Of Zelda series thrives on its reliance on exploring and using all items, from the sword to the magic stone, and by defeating enemies, which Link is tasked to do by the game's overarching story.

A Link Between Worlds was followed by The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap in early 2005. This game is the first in the Legend of Zelda series to feature the Nintendo Switch version of the GameCube controller, which allowed Link to use the Wii Remote's 3-D camera to interact with the game's dungeons.

## Gameplay

Though The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds utilizes the same gameplay mechanics and elements that make up the Legend of Zelda series, such as controlled camera movement and rotational control, the game's story is a much different affair, and has a distinct focus on exploration and puzzles. The game features a story that is told through a series of events, and Link travels from place to place to discover the truth behind his ancestry.

The game is divided into three parts:

### The Great Swamp

The Great Swamp is the first dungeon Link encounters in the game, and is home to all of the enemies and enemies' boss fights in the game. The swamp is controlled by Link's sword, and Link is tasked with rescuing the princess Zelda from the evil Doreen, who has been hiding in the swamp.

### The Forest Of The Dead

The Forest of the Dead is the second dungeon Link encounters in the game, and is home to the many enemies Link encounters throughout the game. The forest is controlled by Link's magic sword, and Link is tasked with defeating the evil Doreen, who has been hiding in the forest.

### The Desert Of The Dead
