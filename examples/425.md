## Gameplay

Crumble: The Trilogy is an arcade game. The game features a lot of different mechanics and turns into a game of strategy as you go through the levels. It can be very difficult to get through each level and you'll have to put a lot of effort into the level from start to finish. The game also features a number of weapons which are lost on the final level. You can only carry a couple of weapons at a time. However, you can carry a lot of weapons at once.

The gameplay in the game is very simple. You're shooting straight line, straight up, straight down and down. Each weapon has various properties and so you'll need to use the correct combination of bullets to get the correct shots. It's very much a shooter, not a platformer.
