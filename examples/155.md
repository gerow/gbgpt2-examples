## Gameplay

The game is a throwback to the days of the Nintendo 64, with a new black screen, a platforming style, and physics-based gameplay. The game is a much better game than its predecessor, with a more realistic physics model, and physical limitations.

In the game, players have to play their best tennis player character in the game. Players can play up to five characters at once, and they can change the character's attributes - the player's ball-handling skills, which determines how far the ball hits the tennis ball (to allow for more open shots and better shots to the net), and the player's technical skill, which determines the ball's spin rate and serves and serves.

The game also has the player controlling the ball's spin rate, and using the ball's spin to hit the tennis balls into the tennis court. The game is more forgiving than a lot of other games of the time, the ball can be hit harder if it is hit into the ball carrier, it also has a secondary effect of hitting the tennis balls that are actually the ball.

The tennis ball is also a much faster and stronger ball than the NES ball, and players have to make a lot more serves and serves. The game also has a special mode where players can play as the player's character as the ball speeds up. The game also has a stronger physics engine and a greater range of serve combinations.

The game also features a number of technical upgrades from the NES version, including a new joystick. The NES version has a different set of controls than the Sega Master System, such as the ability to slalom, a characteristic that was used during the Sega Master System's debut in 1993.

The game also has a new physics engine that works in the direction of the ball's spin, a new set of ball handling controls, and a new power-up system that allows the player to increase the power of the ball.

The game was based off the highest-quality of the arcade game, Virtua Tennis.
