## Overview

Sakura Wars is an arcade shooter developed and published by Sega in 1991. It is the last in the Sega Saturn's original lineup. It was the studio behind the Space Invaders, Star Fox, and Star Fox for Sega.

Sakura Wars is a 3D shooter with a vast world of enemies in a series of levels. Enemies move in the 3D plane, so the player must shoot them with the same gun. The player can equip multiple weapons at the start and can switch between them during the course of the game with the right trigger. The player is able to use a primary weapon, such as pistols and shotguns, or a secondary weapon, such as the RPG.

The RPG can be upgraded with new armaments including the RPG grenade launcher and the RPG rifle, with the latter firing rockets. The RPG can also be upgraded with a new rifle, the RPG-12.

The game features many RPG-like items to aid the player in the combat. Pieces of armor can be upgraded in the inventory with new armaments, such as the RPG shield and the RPG rifle. The RPG-12 can be upgraded with new arms, such as the RPG pistol and the RPG grenade launcher.

The game is a first-person shooter with an emphasis on the RPG-like combat elements, with a large, open world, bullet-hell-filled landscape. The game features a large number of RPG-like weapons, including the RPG grenade launcher and the RPG rifle.

Sakura Wars is often regarded as a prototype for the "arcade" genre of shooters. Its arcade-style gameplay is a stark contrast to the "action" of shooters such as the Ultima series.
