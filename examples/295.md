Time to Die 2 was the sequel to Time to Die, developed by Sierra Entertainment and published by Sierra Entertainment.

Time to Die 2 uses a similar gameplay engine as its predecessor. Time to Die 2 is generally considered to be the better of the two games in the time-honored Sierra tradition of taking a sci-fi and making it accessible to more people. Time to Die 2 offers no new features, such as a real-time biotracker.

## Story

Time to Die 2 is set in the year 2034 A.D. During the year 2170, a group of scientists from the U.C.C.A. come together to help mankind survive the zombie apocalypse.

## Gameplay

Time to Die 2 offers a mixture of arcade-style melee combat and a persistent time-based physics system. Time to Die 2's gameplay is similar to that of its predecessor, but without the time-based linearity and biotracking.

Time to Die 2's melee combat is similar to that of the Time to Die series, but with a number of new weapons and gadgets. Time to Die 2's weapons and gadgets are more cost-effective and deal more damage than those of its predecessor, allowing it to be more fun to play.

Time to Die 2 is a pretty straightforward game. If you want to survive a zombie apocalypse, you get to pick a few guns and a few gadgets. You can also pick up a boomerang, a weapon that shoots energy projectiles the same way a rocket launcher shoots bullets.

## Weapons

#### Shotgun

The shotgun is the best weapon in the game. The shotgun has good damage and great range. It can shoot 3 rounds at a time, which is much better than the rate of fire of the rifle, but not much better than the rifle. However, its speed and range make it a great weapon to start with. The shotgun has a large magazine (20 rounds) and the range of the shotgun makes up for the lack of range.

#### Rifle

The rifle is the second best weapon in the game. The rifle has great range, rapid fire, and damage. However, its damage and range make it a very poor weapon
