## Game Modes    

### Player vs player
   

#### Team mode   

Players can join any team in any order they choose, but each player has to play an individual game of the team. Teams are comprised of three teams and each team has its own set of problems, and these problems are then solved through various gameplay mechanics. The game is broken up into a series of rounds, each team having three difficulties for each problem. The player who solves the most of the problems has the game over, but the player who does not solves the problems wins. The game then ends with the player not having won the game, the judge having also lost the game.
