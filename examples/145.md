## Gameplay

The Spy in the Dark is a simple sense-based action game. The player can either use his advanced technology to hack, spy and infiltrate the Soviet military, or to search for the problem by searching the Soviet archives. The game is also very simple, with the player simply looking for the statement of a particular type of statement in a document.  
  

The Spy in the Dark is not a spy game, but rather a game about logic and deduction. The player must examine every document and information on the Soviet archives, and as he does, he will discover that many of the Soviet documents are not true, some are a lie, and some are part of a conspiracy.  
  
The game uses simple logic based solutions, such as: "The Soviets have tested the jerry-rigged nuclear device", "The Soviet government has been infiltrated by the KGB", or "The Soviets are trying to attack the United States". The player must then decide which one is the truth and which is not.  
  
There are no levels, and the player must travel to the areas "red" and "blue". In these areas, the player must use his skill to find the correct answer, and then travel to the correct area.
  

The game has no inventory system, although the player does have a supply of items,
