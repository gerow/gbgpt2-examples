## Gameplay

The Mystical Ninja follows the same gameplay mechanics as its predecessor. The player uses a sword to attack, and can use the environment to get around obstacles.

In the first level, the player uses the environment to attack the hidden enemy, the Lizardman, who has three health bars. The player can catch him with a bow, however, he will not attack until his health bar is depleted to zero. He won't attack until the player manages to hit 100 health.

The player can see a forest of pitfalls, and destroy them by using the environment to get around them.

The player can get through the game in one hit from a snake that is wielding a sword. The player can attack it with their sword, and if they hit it with the sword, the snake will die.

The player can use the environment to traverse the level, and destroy the traps.

The game has a very easy to master difficulty setting, where the player will have to solve a puzzle, and often would not get the same kind of reward from the environment.

The environmental gameplay also works well, being a great way to get the player through the game.
