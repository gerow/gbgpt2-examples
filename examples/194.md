Chaos Legion is an action-adventure game in which the player is trying to escape the clutches of the wretched city. This game is very similar to Ultima Underworld, in which you were able to escape the prison in a prison-like environment, but in Chaos Legion you are locked in a prison-like environment. The city also includes many traps and hazards, and the player must avoid them and their associated hazards by either locking the prisoner out, or using an escape technique to escape. The game features an open-world gameplay, where the player can explore the world with a large number of objects and creatures, though creatures will often refuse to interact with the player, so the player must use a combination of traps and items to get past them.
