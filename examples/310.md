Crazy Rally is a RTS game, developed by Irem and published by THQ, and it is a sequel to the original 2005 game.

## Overview

Crazy Rally is a racing game developed and published by Irem for the Sega Genesis, Playstation and Saturn.

The game is a high-octane, turn-based RTS with millions of lines of code, and it is a follow-up of the 2004 game Crazy Rally. This time, players are driving a car in a race called T-car, and as the game's script states, the player must make sure not to crash into another car, as the game's setting, from the very beginning, is the top of the world.

The game has been remade many times, and the story is a complete clone of the original game. The game also uses the same engine, whereas the original game used the 3D engine.

## Gameplay

In Crazy Rally, you have dozens of different cars, each one representing a different concept. Every car has a unique theme, and the game has tons of them including vehicles from the same concept. Each theme car has a unique engine, name, and is given an entry in the "T-car" race.

Each theme car has different stats and abilities, and each one has a different set of weapons. Several of these include:

*   Speed - The car can travel faster than a 1.5 tonne, but its limited acceleration makes it difficult to maneuver,
*   Acceleration - The car can move faster than a tonne of cars, but it's limited acceleration makes it easy to sink into a hole,
*   Handling - The car can control better than a tonne of cars. It can reach higher speeds, and can accelerate much faster.
*   Combat - The car can engage in higher amounts of conflicts, and this includes battles against other cars, or vehicles.
*   Equipment - The car can have different types of weapons, as well as different types of engine.

In the game, players can even capture enemy vehicles, and their speed is tracked. The speed of the car can be modified to several levels of increase, and the players are able to choose the speed of their car
