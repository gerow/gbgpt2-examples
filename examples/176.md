## Overview

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is a Nintendo 3DS spin-off of The Legend of Zelda. It was developed by Nintendo themselves and was released on September 16th, 2007 in Japan, November 15th, 2007 in the US and Spring 2013 in Europe. The game is a direct sequel to the 2010 Wii U version of The Legend of Zelda: Shadow of the Colossus and features new gameplay mechanics and gameplay elements from the previous game.

## Gameplay

The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is a puzzle-RPG with a unique mechanic, which is "traveling". You can explore dungeons and towns by walking to the center of the area and using items to travel to the end. Enemies are in the background, so the player can't just walk in and immediately kill the enemy, but instead needs to be maneuvered around the enemy.

### Side-Quests

The side-quests are a staple in any Zelda game. These are optional, but they can be chosen from a large array of choices based on the player's character. The game is very simple, but players can take on a variety of side-quest and will often just have to complete them. The game is still a Zelda-Classic, and players must solve the puzzle of the game, but it is usually a lot easier to solve the side-quest than to solve a simple quest.

### Quests

The Quests are an optional addition to the game, and can be created by the player using items. The objectives are fairly simple, the player needs to complete a task to progress, and the proper item for doing such tasks is never revealed. There are several items, ranging from a sword to a book, which are all required to complete the Quests.
