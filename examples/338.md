## Gameplay

The game has a magic-based system, where the player has to save the princesses, and you have to make sure you are protected.

You must "save princesses" by collecting gems, which are very rare, and that is done in a multiple-turn system.

For example, if you collect all the princesses in a castle, then you can create a magic wand, but you can only use one magical wand at a time.

The game has a good amount of magic-based elements, such as ice magic, fire magic, and lightning magic.

## Upgrades

There are four upgrades to the game.

*   Visor: Allows for the player to see if a princess is in the castle, but you can't go in or out.
*   Player: The player becomes a witch, and when you complete a quest, you become the new owner of the castle.
*   Guard: The guard is the player's partner.
