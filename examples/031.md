# FEATURING MARC GERALD

Empire Games was the brain child of Marc Gerald, Senior Game Designer for the Xbox.

In the game, players can use the Xbox's controller to control characters, and are given the task of playing the "social experiment" by choosing from a diverse collection of over 100 different character-types in a unique set to play through the game world. The game is an adventure game in which the goal is to find key items, such as clothing and weapons, and acquire them through nonlinear, random gameplay.

The game was hugely influential in the genre of adventure games, and is often cited as the first "indie" game, which in turn influenced the adventuring genre.

## Overview

FEATURING MARC GERALD is a turn based RPG featuring extremely stylistic in-depth crafting and combat. It is set in a 1930s European setting, and takes place decades before the events of the original Indiana Jones, in a world where magic is still a normal part of daily life.

Gerald's job is to make sure every possible item is provided for at every point in the game, and to help the player interact with the environment.

The game had some of the most intricate dungeon-crawling in the series, which involved navigating vast environments and a plethora of traps and dangers. The game also had a unique combat system, allowing players to become more violent by dodging the other party's attacks.

The game was a spiritual successor to the first Indiana Jones. It plays much like the first game, as well as the previous one. The game also gave players a number of weapons to make use of on their adventures.
