## Gameplay

Chaos Brigade is a turn-based strategy game featuring large parties of infantry. Players can send out troops to fight against either an enemy or friendly force, either with a character's own army or against AI controlled units. Players must build up a large army with units to fight off the enemy, but generally only the first, third, and fifth units are sent out, and the rest are held in reserve, waiting for the time to be called to action. The player can call out reserves to attack enemies, but their numbers are limited to three or less.

There are a variety of units to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses.

Early in the game, each unit has a base value of 1,000. Units can only be built up to a maximum of 300 units per base.

Each unit has a specific purpose, such as a tank, helicopter, etc.
