The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D takes place in the Kingdom of Hyrule, a fantasy-infused land that was created by Hyrule Castle, a castle built in the Hyrule Castle area of the game.

The main game mechanic is the genealogy system, where Link needs to "mutate" his DNA into a specific form to gain new abilities and lookalikes.
