# Slingback

An intense, bizarre and gross interactive movie about a mysterious man who lives in a house that is haunted. It is the sequel to Samba the Dolphin, and the first in the demo game series which features a number of classic games from the 80s and 90s, including the Atari 2600 classic Pac-Man and the Sega Master System's Mighty Bomb.

## Overview

Slingback is an interactive movie game developed by Codemasters and published by Microsoft for the Xbox in early 2008. The player controls Samba the Dolphin, a mysterious man who lives in a house with a ghost. The house is filled with a variety of bizarre and disturbing items and enemies, with the player trying to avoid the ghost's attacks and avoiding the ghosts' attempts to attack Samba. The game's story is set against the background of the 1980s, and it follows Samba, who is patrolling the house while chasing ghosts. The game's story also includes elements of the infamous "Mighty Bomb", during which the player must use the camera to destroy the ghosts' mouth in order to kill them.

The game's story is told through the player's eyes, and there are multiple endings, including Samba getting through an alien-controlled version of the ultimate ghost-killing game, Space Ghost.

## Gameplay

Slingback is a strange interactive RPG, with the player attempting to avoid the ghosts and making his way to the end.

In addition, Samba is able to pick up objects, which move Samba's face to the edge of the screen, or completely cover the screen. When Samba is surrounded by ghosts, their heads change position, making it harder to see what is going on.

The game is a fast-paced and frantic affair, with the player attempting to avoid the ghosts as they crowd around the house. Samba must avoid the ghosts, and as he does, ghosts are able to hit Samba. Most of the time, the player is able to avoid the ghosts, but if Samba gets too close, the ghosts will eventually pick him up. The ghosts then attack Samba, and he must use his face to attack them, but they are faster, stronger and more difficult to handle.
