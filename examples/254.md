## Overview

Anachronism 2 is an educational game from Ion Storm. The game is a mash-up of video games and educational games. It teaches kids how to pick up and throw rocks. The game is similar to the video games Super Mario Brothers or Star Fox. The game is also similar to computer games, like Pacman or Bomberman, in many ways. The game is a bit more hardcore than most video games, such as the famous Pac-Man. The game also comes with a mode, where the player can launch rocks, but they can only be launched up to a certain height.

## Gameplay

The player has to hit the green button, and then the green button again to start hitting the ball at the proper time, so the ball can hit the ball back at the correct time. The ball then starts to climb the hill, but must avoid the bush-hopping and dinosaur-hopping of the other ball, and must follow the dinosaur-hopping to the end of the hill. After the game is over, the ball can be re-spawned. The game is over if the player hits the wrong button. The ball can only be re-spawned once, and the player can have another ball that is higher than the last, or he can have the ball back on the lower deck, and the ball will have to continue on.
