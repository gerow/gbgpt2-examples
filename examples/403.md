# Chase

Chase is a simulation game developed by the creators of Star Wars: The Old Republic, and released in 1999. Players take the role of a gambler who must explore a massive Island in search of treasures.

## Overview

Chase is a simulation game developed by Autodesk, released in 1999. Players take the role of a gambler who has to search for treasures on the island of Duca, in search of the fortune that the island is rumored to hold.

## Gameplay

Chase is a simulation game, and no comparison can be made to Star Wars: The Old Republic's single player story. The only difference is the amount of time players spend in the game, and the amount of resources they have to work with.

The game is played without planets, and the players are therefore free to explore the island without planets. The island is a vast land, and while this is not unusual in a Star Wars game, it is not unusual in any game.

Chase offers a unique gameplay center, where the player's ship can be a spaceship, or a fighter plane. Their ship is the first to reach maximum speed, and the player then seeks out planets to explore.

Chase also has an item system, where items are collected from planets, and can be used in the game. This item system allows the player to explore a vast planet, and encounters with alien races.

## Gameplay

Chase's gameplay centers around exploration and harvesting resources, and using them in the game. The amount of time invested in exploration varies. If the planet is explored, the player has the chance to get to the planet's gemstone, and begin mining ore.

The game's game mechanics are simple, and require players to use items, and their abilities to find new items. Players must use their ships to find and attack planets, and planets that are attacked.

A planet is a vast land, and while it is not unusual in a Star Wars game, it is not unusual in any game.

## Ships

There are four ships in Chase, as there are in Star Wars: The Old Republic. The player must have a ship in order to travel to the various planets. The player has a limited amount of money, and since the player cannot hire land creatures, they must explore the planet.

The player can either choose one of six ships
