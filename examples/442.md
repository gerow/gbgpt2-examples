L.A. Law

The last game in the Law franchise, L.A. Law is a mandatory puzzle game. It does, however, have a strong 'law' theme to it and players will need to solve the case by having to find out if you can or not. The game was not as scary as the first game, but it does, however, have a strong 'torture' theme to it, as well, as players are forced to stop a torturer from torturing another.

The game features a very simple puzzle game mechanic which players will have to solve by solving a series of levels and the player being given a maximum of 3 clues. The game also features a very basic dialogue system which will often involve the player to give either verbal or written responses to the player's actions. After each level, the player will get to meet the victim who will grant the player a number of clues and reward the player with a number of items. This game was very simple, but very hard to get through.
