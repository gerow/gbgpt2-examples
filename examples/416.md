# Thief 2

The sequel to the critically acclaimed first game, Thief 2 is set in a modern-day police state, and features a number of new puzzles and mechanics. It is the last game in the series, and the last game in the series to be released on PC.

## Overview

Thief 2 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed first game, Thief. Released in 1999, the game's story continued the story of Thimbleweed Park's hero, Tarkir, in a narrative similar to that of many other video games. Despite the name, it is not a sequel to any previous game in the series, but rather a continuation of the story of the protagonist's adventures in the game, and a follow-up to the earlier, critically acclaimed game. The game was released for the PC, Mac, and Windows platforms in 2000.

The game features a number of new puzzles, mechanics and gameplay elements, including the ability to use a variety of different weapons, including pistols, rifles, shotguns, machine guns, and rifles with grenades. The group of thieves are represented by a number of characters from the film and television show, such as Jake Lloyd and Gavin Free.

Thief 2 is notable for being the first video game to feature the "hacking" mechanic, the first to feature the option to execute an online hacking session, and the first to feature an online multiplayer mode. The game features a much more violent hacking system than its predecessor, with more violent objects and more violent dialogue. The main goal of hacking, however, is to steal the information and data of the target, rather than just to kill them.

Thief 2's online features also received a number of updates, some of which were released on the PC. The online mode, which was intended to be a more robust online experience, received a number of bugs, notably the inability to connect to a server, and the possibility of being linked to a server that was not intended for that purpose.

Thief 2 is also notable for being the first video game to use the "sandbox" feature, which allowed the player to create their own game, and create their own difficulty settings. The sandbox mode can be used to create a high-quality game, and allow players to experiment with the game mechanics and map. The sandbox mode can be restored if the game crashes during the game, and will require the player to restart the game.
