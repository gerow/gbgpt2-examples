The game is set in a haunted house, and players must try and make their way to the top of the tower of the house to stop the ghost from reversing his actions.

## Overview

The Old Ghost is a ghost simulator, which is based off of the film Ghost: The Animated Series. The game is very different from other simulators, and when you enter the game, the player is pulled out from the house and placed in a set of rooms, where they attempt to find their way to the top of the tower and exit. The game has a much more realistic approach to the ghost story, and the player must get to the top of the tower so that they can make their way back to their own home.

## Gameplay

The game follows the same basic gameplay of the previous titles, with the exception of different rooms and the introduction of the ghost statue. The game also includes a different method of interacting with ghosts, with the option to examine the statue, talk to it, and cut through the set of ghosts with a doll, which allows you to interact with the ghost in a more realistic way. The game also includes a more complex system of ghostology, with the player having to examine the mansion, the ghosts, and the mansion's many ghosts to find their ways to the bottom of the tower.

The game is very forgiving of mistakes, and the player can learn a lot from what they do and not do. The player has many tools at their disposal, and the player is able to interact with ghosts and other objects, which will give them clues which they can use to find their way back to their home.

During the game, the player is able to help the ghosts by guarding them from attacks, and if they are successful, the player is able to make his way back to his home. The player has a very limited number of ghosts to deal with, and the player is able to interact with them in a more realistic way, they are able to interact with them more logically, and they are able to interact with them more effectively. If they find the ghost statue, they can take it and use it to interact with the ghosts, and they can also interact with the ghost statue and make their way back to
