=s

A fan-made version of the game, with a very similar appearance. This version is entirely free to play, with no in-game currency.

## Overview

=s is a free-to-play, arcade-style game which is based on the Super Famicom's original Famicom console release. The game features many of the same features as other classic Famicom games, such as the back-to-back fireballs, the goal of each stage, and a very simple objective: to hit the green button in a limited amount of time. The player must use these fireballs to damage enemies with their fireballs, and also to damage them with their bombs. The game also features a much more expansive environment than what most other games have.

The game was created by a man who calls himself "Kazuki" after a fight with a demon. The game was originally released for the Irem system, and also for the Game Boy Advance in Japan in 2001. However, the game never made it to North America.
