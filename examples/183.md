## Gameplay

Players choose from six classes in the game, each with their own unique strengths and weaknesses, and in order to achieve their goals they must use their abilities carefully and build a strong squad of companions.  
  
The game features a lot of movement based combat, complete with the ability to move quickly and gracefully.  
  
The game also features an extensive array of weapons, including energy weapons, blaster rifles, cannons, pistols, and shotguns.   
   
Players can use these weapons to knock down and kill enemies, and the result is the destruction of one or more spaces in the enemy squad.   
  

While the game is set in a fantasy setting, the game takes place in the real world, and as such, players must be careful not to ignore the dangers of the environment and the dangers of battle.  
  
 Another important aspect of the game is the squad command. The player selects a squad of four, and controls them in the squad command. The order is chosen by the player.  
   
The squad command is simple. Players take turns to direct the squad, and they can move up and down the path to the mission objective.  
  
In order to achieve this objective, the squad must obtain an objective, which is achieved by either landing a successful hit on a key target.
