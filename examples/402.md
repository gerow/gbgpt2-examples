Galaxy Force

Galaxy Force is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up. It was developed by Koei and published by Kemco for the Famicom Disk System in Japan in 1997.

A remastered version of Galaxy Force, developed by Nerve and published in the US by Sony Computer Entertainment in 1999, is a remastered version of Galaxy Force 2, developed by Koei and published by Sega in Japan in 1999.

Galaxy Force is the sequel to the Famicom Disk System's Galaxy Force, released in 1994. It is the last game in the Galaxy Force series, and the first of the Star Wars series. The player can now customize the *    *    ship with different weaponry to deal with the different types of enemies. The player is able to upgrade the ship's stats to increase its firepower, armor, shields, shielding abilities, and more.

Galaxy Force 2 is the sequel to the Famicom Disk System's Galaxy Force, released later that year. Galaxy Force II's gameplay differs from Galaxy Force's in two ways. First, Galaxy Force II's gameplay is a tactical shooter, where the player must avoid enemy ships while at the same time keeping the ship's shields up and away from enemy ships. The player is able to use various missile launchers, missiles, guns, and bombs to deal with different types of enemies. Second, Galaxy Force II's gameplay more closely resembles that of other side-scrolling shoot 'em up's, with the player trying to reach the objective before destroying their opponents. In this game, the player can fire their missiles, strafe their ship, or shoot their cannonballs, and missiles can hit the shield or cannonballs will fire.

Galaxy Force was re-released in Japan on November 13, 2007 for the Wii Virtual Console.

## Gameplay

During the game's long gameplay, the player must avoid enemy fire, move around the screen, and repair shields and cannons. The game also has to deal with the ship's armor. The player is able to fit the different shields and cannonballs to almost any shape they choose. The player can then use the shield to protect the ship's shield or cannonballs will send them flying, damaging it. If the player's shield gets damaged, he or she can use the shield's cannonballs to help restore the shield, but the cannonballs can only damage a shield once
