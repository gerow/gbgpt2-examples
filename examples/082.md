# The Big Committee

The Big Committee is a third-person, side-scrolling shooter.  
  
 In the game, players are tasked with placing a $20,000 (or more) order and receiving the delivery of a new batch of toys (usually in a small quantity) in the near future. There are a number of priority orders, which are usually followed by more elaborate ones, but sometimes the player just has to choose to handle it all himself, without any warning.

The Big Committee was one of Sega's last major franchises, and it was a critical and commercial success.   
   

Every order placed will not only get you toys, but will also support development of the game.  
  
   

## Sequel

In 1997, Sega announced the sequel of The Big Committee: Sega Tango.   
  
 The sequel is a tie-in to The Big Committee.   
  
In the sequel, the player manages Tango, but he is assigned to the Big Committee by the government to find a new way to bring down the hedge fund, and the Big Committee is tasked with finding a way to do it.

## Art

The Big Committee 2 has the same art style as the original, with the same number of rooms, the same amount of enemies and objects, but with more of an emphasis on puzzles. The Big Committee 2 is a bit more accessible than the Big Committee 1, but there are still many mysteries to be solved.
