# Machinarium

A 3D arcade game, developed by Simtropolis, that features heavily inspired by the arcade classic.

## Overview

Machinarium is a 3D action platformer developed by Simtropolis and published by Interplay Entertainment for PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo 64.

## Gameplay

The game consists of simple jumping and swinging action: the player is able to move around and perform various moves. The game is clearly inspired by the arcade game in which the player jumps and lands on a platform, then moves to the next platform and jumps again. However, rather than the traditional jumping and swinging gameplay of the arcade game, the game is almost entirely platforming with the player climbing up and down platforms.

The game is fairly simple in gameplay, and there are no puzzles to solve. The player simply jumps, jumps, and lands on a platform. As the player approaches platforms with a certain amount of jumping and swinging, they will have a higher level of difficulty unlocked to them: the player will have to land on the platform with respect to the platform, and at a certain level will have to land on a platform to get to the next higher level. The next higher level will be unlocked by landing on the last platform.

The game is very short, but the game is very challenging. The player has a total of 2-4 levels to shoot, and can beat the game in less than a minute. The game has an extremely high difficulty curve for an arcade game, and the player must meet a score threshold before moving on to the next higher difficulty.

The game is also known for its sound design, which consists of a plethora of shimmy noises, exorbitant melodies, and a creepy soundtrack.

## Levels

### Level I - The Mysterious Temple

The Mysterious Temple is the first level of the game. The player is at the bottom of the screen, and must manipulate the platform to reach the top, but can only move up by having the right direction space. This is a rather simple level, which consists of only the player moving up and down different levels, while being able to land on the platform with the right direction space.

The level is very simple in design, with a single platform that the player can move from one platform to the next. The level consists of a series of right-angled platforms, and no moving platforms. The level is easy,
