# Bounty of the Dead

The game's first major expansion, Bounty of the Dead aims to fix many of the major bugs found in the original game.

## Overview

Bounty of the Dead was released by Bethesda Softworks for the PC, Mac, and Xbox on November 23, 2003. The game became a commercial success, with sales reaching Â£20 million in the first week. The game features new enemies and missions, one of the few new features in the series. The game also includes a new special weapon system, called the "Murdered Skull". However, the original game's combat was modified to most realistic and violent ways possible.

## Plot

In the game, a man named R.D. has been executed by firing squad. However, at the end of the game, he is freed. He is then confronted by the shadowy figure of "Master Freeze". Master Freeze tells R.D. that he was sent by the government to eliminate the threat of the "Killers". Master Freeze then proceeds to kill R.D. with a shotgun blast. However, the game seems to indicate that R.D. survived the blast, and is still alive.

## Gameplay

The game's gameplay is based around the traditional "shoot" button. There are several new weapons, items and enemies to be fought, and the player is tasked with killing them all. The game is also an upgrade system, as the player can obtain different equipment from the various professions, such as stand-ins for the "Knight" and "Bard".

*   M-30 - A fully-automatic sniper rifle that fires explosive ammo.

### Weapons
