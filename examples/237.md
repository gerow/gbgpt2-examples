# Battalion 2 

Battalion 2 is a side-scrolling shooter. The player must complete missions set up by the military. The missions are divided up into several levels, each with a number of enemies to kill. The game is a tactical shooter with a beautiful art style. The player is able to upgrade the weapon with new weapons, ammo, and weapons. The player is able to take control of the tank, but must be very careful as his tank cannot move and has no weapons. The combat is much more tactical than the FPS. The game plays very similar to other shooters.

Battalion 2 is an early example of the first person shooter. The game doesn't have a great deal of tactical advantage, but it was a sim-like game where the player could move around the environment.
